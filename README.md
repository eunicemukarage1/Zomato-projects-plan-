# Zomato-projects-plan-
This project presents an analytical dashboard built in Tableau Public to evaluate Zomato's sales performance over time, across cuisines, cities, restaurants, and customer behavior patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights into operational efficiency, customer demand patterns, and partner restaurant performance
## üìä Executive Summary  
Zomato's sales data demonstrates exceptional operational reliability and consistent performance:  

-Total Orders: 148,541
-Completion Rate: 100%
-Cancellation Rate: 0.001% (only 2 problematic orders)
-Problematic Orders: 2

### Key Insights:  
- Growth vs Decline: A strong growth phase from 2017‚Äì2018 peaked (~400M sales in Jan 2018), followed by a decline in 2019‚Äì2020, with the steepest drop in 2020 (~150M).  
- Weekday vs Weekend Trends: Friday shows the highest sales (~260M) ‚Äì a "Friday Peak" effect. Surprisingly, sales decline during weekends, creating a "Weekend Paradox".  
- Cuisine Trends: Sweets & Tandoor generated the highest revenue (442K), followed by Biryani & Bakery (322K).  
- City Insights: Tirupati leads with the highest revenue (174K), followed by Sirsi and Siwan.  
- Restaurant Ratings: Highest revenues are clustered between 3.2 and 4.8 ratings. Some restaurants with 5-star ratings underperform in sales.  

## üí° Recommendations  
1. **Support 5-Star Restaurants with Low Sales**  
   - Promote them via targeted marketing campaigns, discounts, or visibility boosts.  
   - Provide business consulting to balance pricing and demand.  

2. **Leverage Mid-Rated High-Revenue Restaurants (3.2‚Äì4.8)**  
   - Identify best practices and replicate across partners.  
   - Offer loyalty programs to strengthen customer retention.  

3. **Maintain Operational Excellence**  
   - With near-perfect completion, ensure strong customer support continues.  
   - Use predictive monitoring to prevent cancellations or failed deliveries.

## üìà Visualizations Used  
- KPI Cards ‚Äì Total Orders, Completion Rate, Cancellation Rate, Problematic Orders  
- Line Chart ‚Äì Sales Over Time (growth and decline phases)  
- Bar Chart ‚Äì Sales by Day of the Week (Friday Peak vs Weekend Paradox)  
- Bar Chart ‚Äì Revenue by Cuisine Type  
- Bar Chart ‚Äì Revenue by City (Top 10)  
- Scatter Plot ‚Äì Revenue vs Rating (relationship between quality and sales)

### üéØ Project Scope Definition

### üîç Research Questions & Dashboard Analysis

#### Primary Questions the Dashboard Will Answer:

**1. Operational Excellence Analysis:**
- What does Zomato's 99.999% completion rate indicate about their operational performance?
- How many total orders were processed and what was the exact cancellation rate?

**2. Sales Pattern Discovery:**
- What sales patterns emerge across different time periods (2017-2020)?
- How do sales vary by cuisine type and which cuisines generate highest revenue?
- Which cities are top performers in terms of revenue generation?

**3. Temporal Behavior Analysis:**
- Do sales vary significantly between weekdays and weekends?
- Why does the "Weekend Paradox" occur (lower weekend sales)?
- Which specific day of the week shows peak performance?

**4. Quality vs Performance Correlation:**
- How do restaurant ratings correlate with actual revenue performance?
- Do higher-rated restaurants always generate more revenue?

**5. Strategic Focus Areas:**
- Where should Zomato focus to increase both customer satisfaction and partner performance?


#### What WILL Be Presented in the Dashboard:

**Core Analytics Components:**
- **Operational KPIs:** Total orders (148,541), completion rates (100%), cancellation analysis
- **Temporal Analysis:** Sales trends 2017-2020, growth/decline phases, weekday vs weekend patterns
